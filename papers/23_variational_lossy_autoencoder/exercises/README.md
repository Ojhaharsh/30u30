# [Day 23] Variational Lossy Autoencoder — Exercises

This set of exercises walks you through the implementation of the VLAE
architecture, from masked convolutions to full flow-based priors.

| # | Topic | Prerequisites | Difficulty |
|---|-------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | Masked Convolutions | `torch` | Easy (1/5) |
| 2 | Gated PixelCNN Layer | `torch` | Medium (3/5) |
| 3 | Reproducing Collapse | `implementation.py` | Medium (3/5) |
| 4 | IAF Flow Prior | `implementation.py` | Hard (4/5) |
| 5 | Complete VLAE Assembly | `implementation.py` | Hard (5/5) |

## How to Run
```bash
# Run your implementation
python exercise_01_masked_conv.py

# Run solution
python solutions/solution_01_masked_conv.py
```
