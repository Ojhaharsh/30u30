# Exercises for Day 7: The Coffee Automaton

These exercises build up the paper's key measurements and experiments.

| # | Exercise | What You'll Build |
|---|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | `exercise_01_coarse_graining.py` | The core measurement: coarse-grain a grid and compress it |
| 2 | `exercise_02_model_comparison.py` | Run both models, see why interaction matters |
| 3 | `exercise_03_scaling.py` | Replicate the scaling results from Figures 6-8 |
| 4 | `exercise_04_adjusted_graining.py` | Implement Section 6's artifact-removal technique |
| 5 | `exercise_05_compressor_comparison.py` | Try different compressors, replicate Figure 5 |

## How to Use

1. Read the exercise file — it has the problem statement and starter code
2. Try to solve it yourself before looking at the solution
3. Solutions are in `solutions/`

All exercises import from `implementation.py` in the parent directory.
