# Data Folder: Day 27 (Machine Super Intelligence)

This folder is maintained for structural parity with the 30u30 project standards.

In papers like Day 6 (Complexodynamics), this folder contains initial grid states. For Day 27, our "data" represents the binary strings (Universal Turing Machine programs) that define the complexity $K(\mu)$ of our environments.

### Contents:
- **example_program.txt**: A sample bitstring representing a simple environment transition rule.
