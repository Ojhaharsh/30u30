    "# Day 4: Keeping Neural Networks Simple (MDL) 🧠\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Day 4 of 30 Papers in 30 Days!\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we are tackling a profound idea from Geoffrey Hinton (1993): **\"Keeping Neural Networks Simple by Minimizing the Description Length of the Weights\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper introduced the idea that **Compression = Generalization**. If you can describe your model with fewer bits, it will understand the world better.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The Problem**: Why standard networks are \"brittle\" and overconfident.\n",
    "2.  **The Solution**: How adding **noise** to weights forces simplicity.\n",
    "3.  **The Implementation**: Building a **Bayesian Neural Network** from scratch.\n",
    "4.  **The Visualization**: Seeing the famous **\"Uncertainty Envelope\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Big Idea (in 30 seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a teacher grading a student.\n",
    "* **Standard Student (Overfitting):** Memorizes the textbook word-for-word. Gets 100% on the practice test, but fails if you rephrase the question.\n",
    "* **MDL Student (Generalization):** Remembers the *concepts* loosely. Might get a few details wrong, but understands the logic and passes any test.\n",
    "\n",
    "We force the network to be the second student by telling it: **\"You are not allowed to memorize precise weights (e.g., 5.12391). You can only memorize fuzzy ranges (e.g., roughly 5).\"**\n",
    "\n",

    "### 1. Generalization = Compression\n",
    "By punishing the model for having precise weights (the KL term), we forced it to find a **simple solution**. This simple solution generalizes better to the \"Gap\" in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Uncertainty is Useful\n",
    "Unlike a standard Neural Network which would lie confidently in the gap, this model admits \"I don't know.\" This is critical for self-driving cars and medical AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Noise is a Feature, not a Bug\n",
    "We injected noise *during* training. This noise prevented the model from memorizing the data. It's like training a runner with a heavy backpack—when you take it off (or average the results), they are stronger.\n",
