# Day 6 Solutions

Reference solutions for the Day 6 exercises on Aaronson's "The First Law of Complexodynamics" (2011).

**Try to get stuck first.** These are here for when you're genuinely blocked, not as a shortcut.

| # | File | Corresponding Exercise |
|---|------|----------------------|
| 1 | `solution_01_gzip_complexity.py` | KC approximation via gzip — tests on known signals, compression level comparison |
| 2 | `solution_02_coffee_mixing.py` | Coffee mixing simulation — grid creation, swap mechanics, snapshot collection |
| 3 | `solution_03_multiscale.py` | Multi-scale analysis — coarse-graining at multiple scales, Trevisan's heatmap |
| 4 | `solution_04_two_part_codes.py` | Two-part codes — sophistication proxy, verification on simple/random/structured grids |
| 5 | `solution_05_measures_comparison.py` | All measures compared — gzip, coarse KC, sophistication, boundary fraction, entropy |

Each solution imports from `implementation.py` in the parent directory where needed.
