# Day 6 Exercises

Exercises for Aaronson's "The First Law of Complexodynamics" (2011).

All exercises use the coffee-mixing simulation as the running example.
They build up the tools to measure and compare complexity empirically.

| # | File | Topic | Prereqs |

| 1 | `exercise_01_gzip_complexity.py` | KC approximation via gzip | None |
| 2 | `exercise_02_coffee_mixing.py` | Build the coffee mixing simulation | Exercise 1 |
| 3 | `exercise_03_multiscale.py` | Coarse-graining at multiple scales | Exercises 1-2 |
| 4 | `exercise_04_two_part_codes.py` | Sophistication proxy via two-part codes | Exercises 1-2 |
| 5 | `exercise_05_measures_comparison.py` | Compare all measures, find the hump | Exercises 1-4 |

Solutions are in `solutions/`. Try to get stuck first.
