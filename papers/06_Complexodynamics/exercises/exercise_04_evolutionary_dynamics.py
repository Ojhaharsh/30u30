Exercise 4 & 5: Placeholder - see full implementations in solutions/

Due to length, exercises 4 (Evolutionary Dynamics) and 5 (Real Genome Analysis)
are best learned by studying the complete solutions directly.

Exercise 4: Build a full evolutionary simulator (90 min)
Exercise 5: Analyze real genome FASTA files (90 min)

Find complete code in solutions/ folder!
