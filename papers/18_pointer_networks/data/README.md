# Day 18 Data: Pointer Networks

This folder is used for:
- Synthetic sorting sequences.
- 2D coordinate sets for Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP).
- Planar point sets for Convex Hull calculation.

Data is typically generated on-the-fly, but this directory can be used to cache large-scale combinatorial datasets.
