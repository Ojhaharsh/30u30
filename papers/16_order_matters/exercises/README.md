# Day 16 Exercises: Order Matters (Pointer Networks)

Welcome to the exercises for Day 16! 🎯

These exercises will take you from basic pointer attention to a full working system for set-to-sequence problems.

---

## 📝 Exercise Structure

Each exercise builds on the previous one:

1. **Exercise 1:** Implement basic pointer attention mechanism
2. **Exercise 2:** Build order-invariant set encoder
3. **Exercise 3:** Train model to sort numbers
4. **Exercise 4:** Solve convex hull problem
5. **Exercise 5:** Tackle Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, you will:

- ✅ Understand how pointer attention works
- ✅ Implement order-invariant encoders (sets vs sequences)
- ✅ Train models for combinatorial problems
- ✅ Visualize attention patterns
- ✅ Compare set-aware vs order-aware models

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib scipy
```

### How to Use

1. **Start with Exercise 1** - Each file has `TODO` markers
2. **Fill in the missing code** - Hints provided in comments
3. **Run your implementation** - Each file is executable
4. **Check solutions/** - When you're stuck or want to verify

### Running an Exercise

```bash
# Run exercise 1
python exercise_1.py

# With verbose output
python exercise_1.py --verbose

# Test your implementation
python exercise_1.py --test
```

## 📊 Exercise Difficulty

| Exercise | Difficulty | Time | Key Concepts |
|----------|------------|------|--------------|
| 1 | ⭐⭐ Easy | 30 min | Pointer attention, argmax |
| 2 | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium | 45 min | Self-attention, order invariance |
| 3 | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium | 60 min | Training loop, loss functions |
| 4 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hard | 75 min | Geometric reasoning, convex hull |
| 5 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Expert | 90 min | Combinatorial optimization, TSP |

## 💡 Tips

**Stuck?**
1. Check the hints in the code comments
2. Review the main README.md for concepts
3. Look at the analogies in PAPER_NOTES.md
4. Run the solution to see expected output
5. Compare your code with solutions/

**Common Issues:**
- **Attention produces NaN:** Check your masking! Inf values before softmax are fine, but check for divide-by-zero
- **Model doesn't learn:** Try smaller set sizes first (5-10 elements)
- **Memory issues:** Reduce batch size or use gradient accumulation
- **Slow training:** Use GPU if available, or reduce hidden_dim

## 🎓 What You'll Build

By the end, you'll have:
- ✅ A working pointer network implementation
- ✅ An order-invariant set encoder
- ✅ Models trained on 3 different tasks
- ✅ Visualizations of attention patterns
- ✅ Understanding of when order matters and when it doesn't
