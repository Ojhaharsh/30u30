## How to Use These Solutions

### ⚠️ Try First, Then Look

**The best way to learn:**
1. Read the exercise description
2. Attempt the solution yourself
3. Get stuck? That's normal! Try debugging
4. Still stuck? Check hints in the exercise README
5. **Only then** look at the solution

### 📖 Learn from Solutions

When you do look at solutions:
- Don't just copy-paste
- Understand each line
- Compare with your approach
- Note differences in style/efficiency

### ✅ Verify Your Solution

If you solved it differently, that's great! There are many ways to solve problems.

Run both yours and ours to compare:
```bash
python your_solution.py
python solutions/exercise_01_solution.py
```
