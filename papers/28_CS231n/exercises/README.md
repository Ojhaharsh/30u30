# Exercises: Day 28 — CS231n CNNs for Visual Recognition

5 exercises to build CNN components from scratch. Start with exercise 1 and work forward — later exercises build on earlier ones.

| # | File | Topic | Difficulty |
|---|------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | `exercise_01_conv_forward.py` | Implement conv forward pass (naive) | Easy (2/5) |
| 2 | `exercise_02_pooling.py` | Implement max pooling forward + backward | Medium (3/5) |
| 3 | `exercise_03_output_sizes.py` | Compute output dimensions for architectures | Easy (2/5) |
| 4 | `exercise_04_parameter_count.py` | Count parameters in VGGNet-style networks | Medium (3/5) |
| 5 | `exercise_05_feature_viz.py` | Visualize filters and activation maps | Hard (4/5) |

## How to Use

Each exercise file has:
1. A docstring explaining the task
2. Function stubs with clear signatures and docstrings
3. A `check()` function that tests your implementation
4. Hints in comments

Run each exercise to see if your implementation passes:

```bash
python exercise_01_conv_forward.py
python exercise_02_pooling.py
# etc.
```

Solutions are in `solutions/`. Try to get stuck first — that's where the learning happens.

## Prerequisites

- NumPy (all exercises)
- Matplotlib (exercise 5 only)
- Read `implementation.py` if you need to see a complete reference
