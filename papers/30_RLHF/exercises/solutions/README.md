# Solutions: RLHF

These files contain the implementation of the core RLHF components.

| File | Solution For |
|------|--------------|
| `solution_01_bradley_terry.py` | Implementing the preference probability formula (Eq 1). |
| `solution_02_preference_loss.py` | Implementing the cross-entropy loss (Eq 2). |
| `solution_03_reward_norm.py` | Implementing running mean/std normalization. |
| `solution_04_synthetic_oracle.py` | Implementing the simulated human evaluator. |
| `solution_05_rlhf_loop.py` | Stitching the components into a training loop. |

## How to Check Your Work

Compare your implementation in `../exercise_XX.py` with these solutions.
The logic should be similar, though variable names may differ.
