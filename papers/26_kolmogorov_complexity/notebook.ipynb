    "1. **The Problem**: why statistical entropy isn't enough\n",
    "2. **The Solution**: Compression as a proxy for intelligence\n",
    "3. **The Walkthrough**: Building a Huffman Tree bit-by-bit\n",
    "4. **The conveyor belt**: Arithmetic Interval Shrinkage\n",
    "5. **Similarity without Models**: Clusterting with NCD\n",
