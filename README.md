**30u30 is an open-source study guide that takes you through the 30 foundational AI papers recommended by Ilya Sutskever — one paper per day.** 
Each paper comes with a full implementation from scratch, detailed notes, interactive exercises with solutions, and visualizations.  
Think of it as [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), but for deep learning fundamentals. You read the paper, understand the math, and build it yourself.
